                <p>
                    Graduating from the University of Utah in November 2021 with a certificate in Web Development and Coding.
                    I worked as a Sous Chef for nearly a decade. Which has helped me develop a strong leadership presence.
                    I was elected to be Project manager for two of our team projects in class.
                    One was an air quality site that gave current air quality for the city you searched as well as the next three days.
                    The second was a full stack web application built with: Sequelize, Express, Node, MySQL, Dotenv, and JQuery.
                    The third being a MERNG stack application called clean freak.
                    I love to code in JavaScript and React as well as using Apollo Server, GraphQL, and MONGODB Atlas. I am always looking to learn new things and improve my skills.
