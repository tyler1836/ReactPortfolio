                    Graduating from the University of Utah in November 2021 with a certificate in Web Development and Coding. I worked as a Sous Chef for nearly a decade. Which has helped me develop a strong leadership presence. I was elected to be Project manager for two of our team projects in class. One was an air quality site that gave current air quality for the city you searched as well as the next three days. The second was a full stack web application built with: Sequelize, Express, Node, MySQL, Dotenv, and JQuery. Both of these are posted as well as other projects on my personal web page portfolio. I have a passion for coding and creating beautiful and responsive pages. I am always looking to learn new things and improve my skills.
